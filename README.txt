Weather tomorrow in cities

& 

Flights to cities tomorrow

Weatherman uses browser to call to my Weatherman service - initially Weatherman service/app will be used from 
the Weatherman's command line

Two services within app code - one for weather and one for flights
(WeatherService & FlightsService)

use SWAPI api first, as no creds needed...
